#Akari
By: Shannon Little

How to Win:
1) "Light up" all the white cells
2) Have no more than 1 lamp in a row/column. 
3) With tiles that have a number on them, place that number of lamps on the tile(s) touching it. 

Information:
Click on a white tile to place a lamp. Click a lamp to remove it. You cannot place a lamp on black tiles.
Placing a lamp will light up the tiles in the same row and column as it. When the correct amount of lamps has been placed in the tiles directly adjacent to it, the number will turn green. 
This game includes 5 puzzles with varying difficulty in no particular order. You will get a prompt when you win.

Akari is a well known puzzle game. This was a class project to recreate the game using some big ideas we learned throughout the semester: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Observers/Subjects, JavaFX, and Model-View-Controller.

Small Details:
When pressing the "random" button you will never get the current puzzle you are on. This means you should never press the button and have nothing happen. If you are on the first or the last puzzle it will not cause errors if you try to navigate past them. The window automatically resizes itself for the current puzzle.
